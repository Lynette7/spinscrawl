Web crawler - Node.js

Spinscrawl is a web crawler that scrapes websites and stores the retrieved data in a CSV file.
The code base can be modified to scrape information from different websites.
The websites we used for this project are Iban exchange rates and Wikipedia United States webpage.
The technologies used to develop Spinscrawl are:

- Node.js
- Cheerio - a lightweight implementation of jQuery
- Axios - a library for making HTTP requests
- CSV writer - a library for creatingand writing data into a CSV file

To run the files, use the following command:

```
node filename.js
```

and replace 'filename' with the actual name of the file.
